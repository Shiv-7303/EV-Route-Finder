## Route-Finder

This is a Python Flask web application I'm building to simplify route planning! It helps you find the best path between your starting point and destination, providing clear directions, estimated travel time, and distance information – all in a user-friendly interface.

**Tech Stack:**

* Backend: Python Flask
* Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

**Features (Planned):**

* **Route Planning:** Enter your starting point and destination, and the website will calculate the optimal route for you.
* **Multi-modal Support (Planned):**  Choose how you want to travel – driving, biking, walking, or even public transportation (functionality under development).
* **Distance & Time Estimation:** Get an estimate of the distance you'll travel and how long it should take to get there.


**Getting Started (For Local Development):**

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package manager)
* Node.js and npm (for Tailwind CSS)

```
or 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Installs Flask and other Python dependencies.
